# Tool design
We implement the observation sequences for resource-unbounded analysis (RUBA) idea in this tool. Now, it contains two parts for now and more upcomming:

```
                             RUBA
                   ___________|___________
                  |                       |
                 CUBA                    WUBA
                   
```

* CUBA: context-unbounded analysis
* WUBA: write-unbouded analysis
