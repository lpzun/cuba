# Documentation for CUBA

We generate the CUBA documentation with doxygen. Here is the organization of this folder:


- __README.md__ :)

- __makefile__ a make file for generating the documentation

- __cuba.doxyfile__ a configuration file

- __html__ a folder which contains a generated documentation


### Generate the documentation

- Make sure you have doxygen installed on your machine. Then, run

>     make

- To clean up the old documentation, you can run the following command

>     make clean

### Remark

For now, we only generate the documentation in _html_ format.
