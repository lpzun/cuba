# Documentation for CUBA

We generate the CUBA documentation with doxygen. Here is the organization of this folder:

- __makefile__ a make file for generating the documentation

- __cuba.doxyfile__ a configuration file

- __html__ a folder which contains a generated html format documentation


### Generate the documentation

- Make sure you have [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) installed on your machine. Then, run

>     make

- Run the following command to clean the documentation, 

>     make clean

### Remark

For now, we only generate the documentation in __html__ format.
